# TODO [#12]: Better matching of financial statement item names - Income Statement
#
# Would be better to use regex instead of names list. Need to first add that infrastructure,
# then apply it to the Income Statement config.

# Note that each possible extract_name must be unique, it cannot be included in multiple lists
# Also note that all incoming names will be converted to lower case and stripped of punctuation,
# then split on _ and joined with space before matching these names
